## NPM
package manager
All package managers do relatively the same thing. Move files.
Pick a package manager on how well it does that.

All build tools do relatively the same thing. Transform files.
Pick your build tools on how well they do that.

The crew it's self have support....

this where 
## DevDependencies 

come into play

---

unlike other package managers, npm installs a tree of dependencies.

`npm init`

<initializer> can be used to set up a new or existing npm package.

---

A package.json file:

- lists the packages your project depends on
specifies versions of a package that your project can use using semantic versioning rules
- makes your build reproducible, and therefore easier to share with other developers

How do you use an installed package in your code?

require()
module.exports



module.js


---

## `npm install`

![npm install](https://i.octopus.com/blog/2018-05/deploying-nodejs/forrest.jpg)


---

### Three types of `npm install`

* **Dependency** - packages required to run the app
* **Dev Dependency** - packages required only during development
* **Globally** - packages you want to re-use across projects

* no matter how you install a package, it can always be accessed in your code with: 
`require('package-name')`


---

### Installing as a dependency ü§ñ

**How do I do this in the command line?** üñ•

* The long way:
`npm install --save-prod nodemon`
 
* The short way:
`npm i -P nodemon`

* The very short way:
`npm i nodemon`
* ‚Üë regular dependency is the default!


---

### Installing as a dependency ü§ñ

**When would I use this?**

* Use this as your default unless you know that the package you're installing is only going to be used by developers

* e.g. a nodemon server might need to be running for the app to work 


---

### Installing as a dev dependency üëæ

**How do I do this in the command line?** üñ•

* The long way:
`npm install --save-dev tape`
 
* The short way:
`npm i -D tape`


---

### Installing as a dev dependency üëæ

**When would I use this?**
* Use this when you know the package will only be needed for development
* e.g. testing is needed for us devs, but not for someone using our app.



---

### Installing globally üåç

**How do I do this in the command line?** üñ•

* The long way:
`npm install --global nodemon`
 
* The short way:
`npm i -g nodemon`


---

### Installing globally üåé

**When would I use this?**
 
* If you find that you re-use certain packages over and over in your projects, you may want to use this to install something globally
* e.g. you may want to use nodemon for testing/server in lots of your projects



---

### Installing globally üåè

**Why this might be a bad idea...**

* You might want to have multiple different projects all working with different packages
* If you want to make a project that works when someone else clones it from GitHub, it needs to be self-contained
* If you update a global package, this may cause problems for projects in terms of backwards-compatability

# Where does NPM install packages? 

![sohot](https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2xWsutZRLaiK5y/source.gif)

---

### 1. Global libraries.
### 2. Non-global libraries.

![sohot](https://media.giphy.com/media/vbD9OoDgUOpkk/giphy.gif)

---

#### Global libraries

Run 
```
npm list -g
```
**Unix:** 
```
/usr/local/lib/node
/usr/local/lib/node_modules
```

**Windows XP -** 
```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\npm\node_modules
```
**Windows 7, 8 and 10 -** 
```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules
```

---

# Non-global libraries
![sohot](https://media.giphy.com/media/bGGpcIS8PX1pm/giphy.gif)

---

#### Non-global libraries

Run
```
npm list
```
In the `node_modules` file.

Run `npm list`- shows installed non-global libraries for current location.

---

#### Why is it important to make sure that installed packages aren't included in your repositories?

Q: Why include or not?

---

# Reasons for not including:
![sohot](https://media.giphy.com/media/KTW9FIyPKTFcI/giphy.gif)

---

#### Reasons for not including:

1. Keep your repo smaller.
e.g. node_modules is humongous.
2. Installed packages included in your repository will become out of date
i.e. a user may have to run npm install again anyway.
3. Users may wish to change packages or check before running project
e.g. if making project compatible with an existing project.

---

### Reasons for including:

---

#### Reasons for including:

1. Removes the risk that 5 years down the line your code breaks., 
e.g. a particular dependency no longer works.
2. If Github has network issues, and you require the user to run `npm i` in order to use your project, your code will break.

---

#### How do you prevent Git from including these files in your repository?
![sohot](https://media.giphy.com/media/102AsbWPQZXbeU/giphy.gif)

---

1. Create a `.gitignore` file in your repository.
2. Add the line below onto its own line, in this file:

```/node_modules```

3. Now your node_modules file will ignored by git.
