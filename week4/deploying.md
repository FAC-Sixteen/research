### Cloud Platforms
- In the beginning there was the internet, a technology that accelerated society in a shorter time than any other.
- Then came the cloud, a type of internet-based computing that enables on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resourses.

### Why is a cloud platform useful? 
**Cost** - Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software.
**Speed** - Most cloud computing servives are provided as self service and on demand.
**Global Scale** - The ability to scale elastically. Delivering the correct amount of IT resources(more/less computing power,storage and bandwidth) where it's needed, from the correct geographical location.
**Productivity** - On-site data centres require a lot of hardware setup, software patching and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend more time achieving more important business goals.
**Performance** - The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure data centers, which are regularly updated to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware.
**Security** - Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies and controls that strengthen your overall security. Protrecting you from possible threats.

### What is PaaS?
- **Platform as a Service(PaaS)** is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing individuals to develop, run and manage applications.
- Because the underlying infrastructure is already written, tested, and optimized, the platform allows for low-code development that doesnt take a seasoned programmer to create something valuable

### What is Heroku?

- **Heroku** is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps â€” they're the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.

### Alternates to Heroku

* AWS
* Oracle Cloud
* Nebula (NASA)
* Microsoft Cloud Services (Azure)

## Environment Variables
- a way of storing sensitive data such as:
-- API keys
-- Login credentials 
-- Database passwords
- env2 allows you to store your environment variables in an env.json or a .env which you would then add to your .gitignore file so that all your sensitive information wouldn't be public on GitHub
