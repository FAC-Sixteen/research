# Node Shell

* Using the instructions here, create your own test output formatter (a test output formatter is a program that when you pipe the results of your tests into, will read the results of those tests and provide you with useful information about them e.g. tap-spec, tap-nyan)
 
* Bonus: Publish your package to npm
