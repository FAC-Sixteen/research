WHAT IS DATABASE MIGRATION 


- A Database migration is performed on a database when it's necessary to update or revert that database to a newer or older version (allows for fixing mixtakes)
- Database migration refers to the management of incremental or reversible changes to database schemas. 
- performed programmatically by using a schema migration tool
- Developers no longer need to remove the entire test database in order to create a new test database from scratch (e.g. using schema creation scripts from DDL generation tools).
